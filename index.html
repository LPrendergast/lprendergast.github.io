        <h3>Why is React.js taking over theÂ world? 02/02/2020</h3>
        <p>I'm sure most of you have heard of React.js by now. I'm guessing the only way you couldn't have heard about it (if you're a developer, that is) is if you lived under a rock, or still hunt animals in the wild with a spear.
            React has slowly but surely been creeping its way onto nearly every Job Description that I see in my search for a position, replacing the likes of Angular and not giving Vue.js a chance. Surely Front End frameworks, based on the same language, must be similar in a sense. Surely they can all do the same things in regards to the functionality of client facing applications, so why or how is React seemingly taking over Front End Development? In this blog I aim to try and figure out the reason for this.
            It is worth mentioning that React did take a dive in its popularity due to copyright issues with using the Framework. Basically, a few years ago, it was found that software / apps built using the framework would technically belong to Facebook, which is an obvious deterrence from ever touching it. They swiftly fixed that and now all is forgiven (or we just forgot).<br>
        </p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>React was created by Jordan Walke, a Facebook developer, in 2011 and its first use case in Facebook development was with the News Feed.
            As of 2019 it has overtaken Angular as the most popular Front End framework on Stackoverflow and is currently used by Facebook (Woah, really?), Uber, Paypal, WhatsApp, the list is seemingly endless.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Why is it so goodÂ then?</h3>
        <p>One of the defining differences between React and other frameworks is that it technically isn't a framework (silly, I know). Full frameworks like Angular, come with a lot of code and packages straight out of the box. React makes use of reusable components and packages of pre-made code that can easily be implemented into any codebase. This adds to added flexibility when developing user interfaces. There are less design / code patterns to follow which gives developers more freedom to develop custom applications to how they see fit.
            This library and package system fits really well into its component based structure.
            It has a separate library for accessing and manipulating the DOM and also uses something called the 'virtual DOM'. The Virtual DOM acts sort've like a screen door between the actual DOM and itself. React compares both, constantly, checking to see if either is different from one another and will only change the actual DOM if needs be. This makes it lightning quick to show changes on the client side of an application.
            React has an exponentially growing ecosystem due to its high demand and usage which will only benefit it and the speed of delivery of code in the future. And with companies like the ones mentioned above, it will only continue to grow. It's also worth mentioning that Facebook have an incredibly detailed and open documentation of the library that goes into great detail of every aspect which can be seen here: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
            Its use of the JSX format is very intuitive if you're familiar with HTML at all. JSX looks like the child of Javascript and HTML and Babel compiles it to Javascript code which can be read by almost any browser. This makes the entirety of the code easier to understand and easier to learn.<br>

        <h3>A bit about ReactÂ Native 09/02/2020</h3>
        <p>In the last instalment of my 'Learning about everything at a high level' series, I wrote about the ins and out of React.js, a Javascript framework developed by Facebook. I thought it was fitting to keep on the React train and delve into React Native and see what makes it tick. The blog post before that was written about GraphQL, also created by Facebook. I swear I'm not a Facebook fanboy, they just make cool tech.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Facebook was initially developed in 2013 and fully released to the public in 2015. It's worth mentioning that Facebook held an internal Hackathon to help promote and develop the framework.
          Since its release 5 years ago, it has racked up quite an impressive list of companies that use it in their stack including: Walmart, Instagram, Bloomberg, Microsoft and Wix.
          Later in 2015 Facebook announced that React Native could compile to Android devices as well as iOs devices, making it a lot more versatile than other technologies on the market. I attended a React Native talk recently, and it was said that React Native will be coming to desktop/macOs. This will give the framework access to pretty much everything. One framework that can create it all.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Why is it so goodÂ then?</h3>
        <p>It gives developers the ability to reuse code while developing cross-platform applications. Instead of writing separate or different code for desktop or mobile they can reuse the written code and make slight tweaks. This saves a lot of time and reduces the overall development cost of an application. It also helps that the syntax is similar when comparing React / React Native (obviously). This would ease the change of switching from the 2 frameworks. Imagine having one codebase for multiple platforms, easy and clean.
          The fact that it's a javascript framework that can build iOs applications, means that finding developers to build those apps would be easier. If you know Javascript or React it should be quite easy to pickup. Pretty handy to not have to look for separate Android and iOs developers that can work together, right?<br>

        <h3>What in the world isÂ DevOps? 15/02/2020</h3>
        <p>In the last instalment of my 'Learning about everything at a high level' series, I wrote about the ins and out of React.js, a Javascript framework developed by Facebook. I thought it was fitting to keep on the React train and delve into React Native and see what makes it tick. The blog post before that was written about GraphQL, also created by Facebook. I swear I'm not a Facebook fanboy, they just make cool tech.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>I'm sure some of you reading this have thought 'What in the world is that DevOps carry on?'. Throughout my studies at Flatiron and on the job learning as a tech recruiter, there was always something that I never understood, even slightly. That is the practice or section of software known as DevOps. I spoke to countless people DevOps roles and while they tried to explain to me what they did in their position, it went straight over my head every single time. I can't even think of their title. Are they DevOps developers, or DevOps Ops people? I'm still not entirely sure.
I took to the internet multiple times to try and figure out exactly what counts as DevOps and every time I failed miserably. The infinite amount of tools and programs that DevOps practitioners use is endless, forever growing and forever confusing.Â 
Now that I have a tonne of time on my hands (hah), I thought it was a perfect situation to finally figure out what makes DevOps think. Or die trying. (Not really)
TLDR; It's IT crossed with software development. Wahey.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>History & What itÂ is.</h3>
        <p>The initial idea was created by a project manager named Patrick Debois. He founded a conference that started in 2009 to showcase the practices of combining software and IT into one role. His frustrations over the disparity between operations and development eventually lead to the practices we know today as DevOps. While he was working he found the time spent migrating from operations like server or database network design and software was too great and slowed down the entire process.
In 2009 a conference / talk lead by John Allspaw, a Flickr employee, brought DevOps to the main stage. It can be read here: https://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/10-deploys-per-day-dev-and-ops-cooperation-at-flickr.Â 
The talk made the case that the way forward in terms of developing was to create a bridge or glue the Dev and Ops activities into one.
Considering Development and Operations being one entity, this means that employing or applying DevOps practices into your organisation is a journey rather than a tool. It's about continuously growing and bettering the software, network or database etc. Constant state of evolution.<br>
