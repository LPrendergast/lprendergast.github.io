        <h3>Why is React.js taking over theÂ world? 02/02/2020</h3>
        <p>I'm sure most of you have heard of React.js by now. I'm guessing the only way you couldn't have heard about it (if you're a developer, that is) is if you lived under a rock, or still hunt animals in the wild with a spear.
            React has slowly but surely been creeping its way onto nearly every Job Description that I see in my search for a position, replacing the likes of Angular and not giving Vue.js a chance. Surely Front End frameworks, based on the same language, must be similar in a sense. Surely they can all do the same things in regards to the functionality of client facing applications, so why or how is React seemingly taking over Front End Development? In this blog I aim to try and figure out the reason for this.
            It is worth mentioning that React did take a dive in its popularity due to copyright issues with using the Framework. Basically, a few years ago, it was found that software / apps built using the framework would technically belong to Facebook, which is an obvious deterrence from ever touching it. They swiftly fixed that and now all is forgiven (or we just forgot).<br>
        </p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>React was created by Jordan Walke, a Facebook developer, in 2011 and its first use case in Facebook development was with the News Feed.
            As of 2019 it has overtaken Angular as the most popular Front End framework on Stackoverflow and is currently used by Facebook (Woah, really?), Uber, Paypal, WhatsApp, the list is seemingly endless.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Why is it so goodÂ then?</h3>
        <p>One of the defining differences between React and other frameworks is that it technically isn't a framework (silly, I know). Full frameworks like Angular, come with a lot of code and packages straight out of the box. React makes use of reusable components and packages of pre-made code that can easily be implemented into any codebase. This adds to added flexibility when developing user interfaces. There are less design / code patterns to follow which gives developers more freedom to develop custom applications to how they see fit.
            This library and package system fits really well into its component based structure.
            It has a separate library for accessing and manipulating the DOM and also uses something called the 'virtual DOM'. The Virtual DOM acts sort've like a screen door between the actual DOM and itself. React compares both, constantly, checking to see if either is different from one another and will only change the actual DOM if needs be. This makes it lightning quick to show changes on the client side of an application.
            React has an exponentially growing ecosystem due to its high demand and usage which will only benefit it and the speed of delivery of code in the future. And with companies like the ones mentioned above, it will only continue to grow. It's also worth mentioning that Facebook have an incredibly detailed and open documentation of the library that goes into great detail of every aspect which can be seen here: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
            Its use of the JSX format is very intuitive if you're familiar with HTML at all. JSX looks like the child of Javascript and HTML and Babel compiles it to Javascript code which can be read by almost any browser. This makes the entirety of the code easier to understand and easier to learn.<br>
